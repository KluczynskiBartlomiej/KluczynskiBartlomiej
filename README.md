# Bart≈Çomiej Kluczy≈Ñski

### HI, I'm Bartek üëã

## About Me

### Hello! I'm Bart≈Çomiej Kluczy≈Ñski, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ University of Technology under the supervision of Professor Tomasz Cie≈õlak. My doctoral research focuses on the application of control theory to economic problems. I began my academic journey at the same university in 2012, completing my master's degree in 2018, and I am now in the final stages of my doctoral studies.

## My Interest in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence

### My interest in data analysis and artificial intelligence was sparked in mid-2022. Having previously programmed in C++, R, and ADA during my studies, I took the initiative to learn Python. To deepen my understanding of computer science, I completed courses like CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, Python, and Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, I have been fortunate to learn from friends who are experts in the field‚Äîone teaching data analysis and AI to students and another with a decade of commercial experience in AI.

## Looking Forward

### I am eager to explore opportunities at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. My academic background, combined with my newfound skills in Python and AI, positions me uniquely to contribute to projects and research in these domains.

## Contact Me

### Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or any exciting opportunities in the field of data analysis and artificial intelligence.
